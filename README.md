# vibemath Template

This repository serves as the starting template for students in the vibe coding class. It contains a short guide of prompts to follow when building a small Flask-based Python package using modern best practices.

See [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) for the recommended sequence of prompts.

In addition to the prompts, a `.cursorrules` file is included to configure Cursor with Python best practices.
