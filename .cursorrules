- Prefer the `src/` layout and manage packages with `pyproject.toml` using `setuptools`.
- Include dependencies explicitly and keep functions modular and readable.
- Use `pytest` for tests located in the `tests/` directory.
- Avoid insecure uses of `eval`; prefer safe evaluation methods or sandboxes.
